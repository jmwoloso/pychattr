# README

This is a Python implementation based on the ChannelAttribution package in R developed by Davide Altomare and David Loris.

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ChannelAttribution/ChannelAttribution.pdf

**Please Note:** The authors of the original R library now also provide a python implementation of [ChannelAttribution](https://pypi.org/project/ChannelAttribution/) which you should probably use instead of my implmentation since there's has additional features not available in this package.
